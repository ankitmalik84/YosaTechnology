    "question": "What according to you are the key factors which determine a project’s success?",
    "answer": "Communication - A project is inclusive of client expectations, timelines, operational instructions, metrics, and several other factors. Collaboration, communication, and documentation are pith and core of a project lifecycle. Therefore, communication is kept taut between our project team and clients to achieve a successful outcome. Assumptions have no place in our project workflow because it can lead to misinterpretation of requirements, unwarranted delays, and complications in deliverables. We also document clarifications, queries, and extra information exchanged between stakeholders to ensure clarity., Transparency - We ensure transparency throughout the project by detecting and resolving problems before it’s too late to attempt a simple fix. We commit ourselves to make the project execution simpler for seamless backtracking., Transition - We never overlook the transition phase of the project because simple missteps can cause a daisy-chain effect, affecting other areas of the project. Therefore, we take special care to completely suppress the minor problems that can come back to haunt in the post-transition phase., Supervision by Senior Management - When project members work under tight deadlines, it is possible for a minor flaw or glitch to go unnoticed. This is because the staff handling the transition and everyday interactions can view those tasks as a mere extension of their routines. However, under the supervision of a senior management executive, potential risks can be reversed in its track before it becomes a complication., SPOC - Our project management team is incomplete without a single point of contact. Our SPOC will liaise with the project team to ensure there are no pending approvals and requests for resources. They play a critical role in meeting the requirements of the project members during the project. They hold the authority and access to key resources to avoid delays on deliverable outcomes."
