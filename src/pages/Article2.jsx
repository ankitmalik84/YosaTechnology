              2019 was marked in golden letters for the teleradiology industry.
              Sudden changes in the technology caused a paradigm shift in the
              way the radiology information of patients were treated. The change
              accelerated customer satisfaction and improved patient care.
              Teleradiology solved most issues with transferring radiology
              images from one place to another. It became time-saving and
              benefited many hospitals and diagnostic centers. It shrunk the
              workload drastically, and streamlined collection of second
              opinions without the overhead of human hours. We predict that by
              2023, Teleradiology services would etch a new record through
              innovation and technology. Below are some of the latest
              Teleradiology trends, and their possible impact in the long run.

              The mention of radiology today is incomplete without the
              simultaneous mention of teleradiology. Thanks to the availability
              of the internet in every corner of the world, it has become easier
              to share information/images with different diagnosticians,
              hospitals, and private clinics. Therefore, we have listed the

              The Cloud not only ushered radical changes in radiology and
              healthcare, but it also promises growth in other industries.
              Thanks to the cloud services, hospitals, and diagnostic centers
              can easily store their data into a virtual storage space. This
              frees up their offline server space, finally resulting in three

              Teleradiology outsourcing trends are increasing for a reason. It
              is expected that soon, teleradiology will get ahead of PACS and
              RIS systems to become the primary choice of teleradiology
              services. Workflow management will not be limited to reading
              images and reporting features. It will include smarter tools that
              will enable physicians to analyze images efficiently, reducing any
              chances of error in the healthcare industry. A community of
              qualified radiologists can be contacted by the internet at
              flexible timings. This trend is seeing an upsurge, thanks to the
              availability of collaborative-tools that allow radiologists to
              hold conversations with one another online. The same tools come in
              handy when a diagnostician wishes to point out abnormalities in CT
              or MRI scans.

              Healthcare has been a center of focus for quite some time now. It
              is expected that the global teleradiology market will grow in the
              consumer’s direction. It is already possible for the consumers to
              view expert opinions and test results online, thus pushing
              consumerism towards a breakthrough. Websites are being created to
              channel consumer-based interactions with healthcare specialists
              online. Such websites require patients to submit their original
              teleradiology images so that a proper diagnosis can be given. The
              consumer is asked to save these on HIPAA-compliant, and regulated
              database for easy usability. The advanced technology has
              instigated millions of patients to come ahead and get second
              opinions, easily. Hopefully, this trend is here to stay.

              Smartphones have already taken over the world. Almost all of us
              have access to smart mobile phones that does a little more than
              just communicating with people. It is also easier for medical
              professionals to access information of their patients, especially
              owing to their busy schedules. This way, even if neurosurgeons,
              cardiologists, oncologists, etc., are not available for
              face-to-face conversation, they can just access the app and share
              their medical opinions with patients. Many other apps focusing on
              other diseases are also being created to provide a variety of
              platforms for acute strokes, heart diseases, amongst others. This
              will ensure that radiologists are able to engage with a patient’s
              problem urgently and provide a quick diagnosis.

              3D report viewing is the next level of Teleradiology. It enables
              healthcare specialists to clearly view information on reports
              without physically holding one. The transition from 2D report
              viewing to a 3D report viewing is a milestone in the field of
              teleradiology outsourcing and app development. Until a few years
              ago, 3D report viewing was only considered a privilege of
              radiologists, and only high-end workstations could have access to
              it. However, now, the evolution of technology has led to the
              invention of solutions that allow 3D imaging of reports possible.
              Now, clients simply must download 3D viewing apps, instead of
              going between multiple servers to achieve clear 3D imaging.
