              A project is inclusive of client expectations, timelines,
              operational instructions, metrics, and several other factors.
              Collaboration, communication, and documentation are pith and core
              of a project lifecycle. Therefore, communication is kept taut
              between our project team and clients to achieve a successful
              outcome. Assumptions have no place in our project workflow because
              it can lead to misinterpretation of requirements, unwarranted
              delays, and complications in deliverables. We also document
              clarifications, queries, and extra information exchanged between
              stakeholders to ensure clarity.

              in the post-transition phase.

              When project members work under tight deadlines, it is possible
              for a minor flaw or glitch to go unnoticed. This is because the
              staff handling the transition and everyday interactions can view
              those tasks as a mere extension of their routines. However, under
              the supervision of a senior management executive, potential risks
              can be reversed in its track before it becomes a complication.
