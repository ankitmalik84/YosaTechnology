            We use return email addresses to answer the email we receive. Such

            We use non-identifying and aggregate information to better design
            our website and to share with partners and associates. For example,
            we may reveal that X number of individuals visited a certain area on
            our website, or that Y number of men and Z number of women filled
            out our registration form, but we would not disclose anything that
            could be used to identify those individuals.

            Finally, we never use or share the personally identifiable
